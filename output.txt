Tests on the higher dimension Adam vs. the normal version (11/20/25)
  - They give nearly exactly the same results except for minor differences. The most likely reason is due to the jax gradient function,
    instead of using sympy to do the computation. 
  - Often on smaller results the difference was only by 1 or two iterations, but it got up to about 6 as well.
  - The higher dimension version also takes significantly longer and I don't know why yet. 
    * It could be because of how I am computing the functions (i.e structured for higher dim) or it could be the jax grad function.
